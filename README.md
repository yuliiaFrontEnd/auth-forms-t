# auth-forms-t
Prepared a markup of the test task, to view it, it is enough to open 
the html files in the browser, did not link the shtml and also did not add validation, 
only added required for the fields.
I used a koala for compilation of SCSS files, as it is more suitable and easier to create a markup
Made everything one commit, since the task is not large.
